  5 6 7 8
  6 7 8
  7 8 
  8
```

4. The straight-line method of computing the yearly depreciation of the value of an item is given by

line:
```
Smallest integer            The given               Lergest integer
not less than                number                 not greater than
the number                                          the number
```

6. The total distance travelled by a vehicle in t seconds is given by
```
distance = ut + ( a t*2 ) / 2
```
> Where u is the initial velocity (metres per second), a is the acceleration (metres per second 2 ). Write a
program to evaluate the distance travelled at regular intervals of time, given the values of u and a.
> The program should provide the flexibility to the user to select his own time intervals and repeat the
calculations for different values of u and a .

7. In inventory management, the Economic Order Quantity for a single item is given by
```
EOQ = sqrt((2*setup costs) / (demand rate * holding cost per unit time))
```
and the optimal Time Between Orders
```
TBO = sqrt ((2* setup costs) / (demand rate * holding cost per unit time))
```
Write a program to compute EOQ and TBO, given demand rate (items per unit time), setup costs (per
order), and the holding cost (per item per unit time).

8. For a certain electrical circuit with an inductance L and resistance R, the damped natural
frequency is given by
```
Frequency = sqrt ((1 / L*C )- (R*R / 4*C*C)
```
It is desired to study the variation of this frequency with C (capacitance). Write a program to calculate
the frequency for different values of C starting from 0.01 to 0.1 in steps of 0.01.

9. Write a program to read a four digit integer and print the sum of its digits.
Hint: Use / and % operators.

10. Given three values, write a program to read three values from keyboard and print out the largest of
them without using if statement.

11. Write a program to read two integer values m and n and to decide and print whether m is a multiple of n.

12. Write a program to read three values using scanf statement and print the following results:
```
(a) Sum of the values
(b) Average of the three values
(c) Largest of the three
(d) Smallest of the three
```

13. The cost of one type of mobile service is Rs. 250 plus Rs. 1.25 for each call made over and above 100
  calls. Write a program to read customer codes and calls made and print the bill for each customer.

14. Write a program to print a table of sin and cos functions for the interval from 0 to 180
degrees in increments of 15 a shown here.
>
| x (degrees) | sin(x) | cos(x) |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ |
| 0           | ...    | ...    |
| ...         | ...    | ...    |
| ...         | ...    | ...    |
| 180         | ...    | ...    |

15.  Write a program to compute the values of square roots and squares of the numbers 0 to 100 in steps
10 and print the output in a tabular form as shown below.
>
| Number | Square Root | Square |
| ------ | ----------- | ------ |
| 0      | 0           | 0      |
| 100    | 10          | 10000  |

16.   Write a program to illustrate the use of cast operator in a real life situation.

17.   Write a C program to shift the given data by two bits to the left.

not.

21.   Write a C program that reads two numbers and performs their division. If the division is not
possible, then an error messgage, ‘Division not possible’ is displayed.
