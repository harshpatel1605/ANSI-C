2. Write a program to read the values of x and y and
print the results of the following expressions in one
line:
```
(a) (x+y) / (x-y)
(b) (x+y) /2
(c) (x+y)(x–y)
```

3. Write a program to read the following numbers, round them off to the nearest integers and print out
the results in integer form: 35.7 50.21 – 23.73 – 46.45

4. Write a program that reads 4 floating point values in the range, 0.0 to 20.0, and prints a horizontal bar
chart to represent these values using the character * as the fill character. For the purpose of the chart,
the values may be rounded off to the nearest integer. For example, the value 4.36 should be
represented as follows.
```
            *      *     *        *
            *      *     *        *         4.36

```
> Note that the actual values are shown at the end of each bar.

5. Write an interactive program to demonstrate the process of multiplication. The program should ask
