Next, compute the speed at which the car travelled.

6. Write a C program to print the current system date.

7. Given two integers 20 and 10, write a program that uses a function add( ) to add these two numbers
and sub( ) to find the difference of these two numbers and then display the sum and difference in
the following form:
```
20 + 10 = 30
20 – 10 = 10
```

8. Modify the above program to provide border lines to the address.

        ---------              ---------
```

11. Area of a triangle is given by the formula
```
         A = sqrt(s*(s-a)*(S-b)*(s-c))
```
Where a, b and c are sides of the triangle and `2S = a + b + c`. Write a program to compute the area of
the triangle given the values of a, b and c.

12. Write a program to display the following simple arithmetic calculator

       sum                 Difference=
       Product=            Division=
```

13. Distance between two points (x 1, y 1) and (x 2, y 2) is governed by the formula
```
D2 = ( x2 – x1 )^2 + ( y2 – y1 )^2
```
Write a program to compute D given the coordinates of the points.
