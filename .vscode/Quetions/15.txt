1. Define a macro PRINT_VALUE that can be used to
print two values of arbitrary type.

2. Write a nested macro that gives the minimum of
three values.

3. Define a macro with one parameter to compute the
volume of a sphere. Write a program using this
macro to compute the volume for spheres of radius
5, 10 and 15 metres.

4. Define a macro that receives an array and the
number of elements in the array as arguments. Write
a program using this macro to print out the elements
of an array.

5. Using the macro defined in the exercise 15.4, write a
program to compute the sum of all elements in an
array.

6. Write symbolic constants for the binary arithmetic
operators +, â€“, * and /. Write a short program to
illustrate the use of these symbolic constants.

7. Define symbolic constants for { and }
and printing a blank line. Write a small program
using these constants.

8. Write a program to illustrate the use of stringizing
operator.

9. Write a simple C program to demonstrate how a
user-created file in included in a C program.

10. Write a C program that uses the
#error directive to stop the program execution when
an error is encountered.

11. Write a C program that uses macro substitution to
compute the area of a rectangle.

12. Write a C program to implement a macro named
NOTEQUAL that performs logical not operation.
