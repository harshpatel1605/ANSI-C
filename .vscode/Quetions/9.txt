1. Write a program, which reads your name from the keyboard and outputs a list of ASCII codes, which represent your name.

2. Write a program to do the following:
```
(a) To output the question “Who is the inventor of C ?”
(b) To accept an answer.
(c) To print out “Good” and then stop, if the answer is correct.
(d) To output the message ‘try again’, if the answer is wrong.
(e) To display the correct answer when the answer is wrong even at the third attempt and stop.
```

3. Write a program to extract a portion of a character string and print the extracted string. Assume that m characters are extracted, starting with the nth character.

4. Write a program which will read a text and count all occurrences of a particular word.

5. Write a program which will read a string and rewrite it in the alphabetical order. For example, the word STRING should be written as GINRST.

6. Write a program to replace a particular word by another word in a given string. For example, the word “PASCAL” should be replaced by “C” in the text “It is good to program in PASCAL language.”

7. A Maruti car dealer maintains a record of
sales of various vehicles in the following form:
```
	Vehicle types   Month of sacles     Price
	MARUTI-800        02/01             210000

	MARUTI-VAN        08/02             240000
```
Write a program to read this data into a table of strings and output the details of a particular vehicle sold during a specified period. The program should request the user to input the vehicle type and the period 
(starting month, ending month).

8. Write a program that reads a string from the keyboard and determines whether the string is a palindrome or not. (A string is a palindrome if it can be read from left and right with the same meaning. For example, Madam and Anna are palindrome strings. Ignore capitalization).

9. Write program that reads the cost of an item in the form RRRR.PP (Where RRRR denotes Rupees and PP denotes Paise) and converts the value to a string of words that expresses the numeric value in words.
For example, if we input 125.75, the output should be “ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AND PAISE SEVENTY FIVE”.

10. Develop a program that will read and store the details of a list of students in the format
```
    Roll No      Name           Marks obtained
    ........     ......         .........
    ........     ......         .........
    ........     ......         .........
```
and produce the following output list:
```
	(a) Alphabetical list of names, roll numbers and marks obtained.
	(b) List sorted on roll numbers.
	(c) List sorted on marks (rank-wise list)
```

11. Write a program to read two strings and compare them using the function strncmp( ) and print a message that the first string is equal, less, or
greater than the second one.

12. Write a program to read a line of text from the keyboard and print out the number of occurrences of a given substring using the function strstr ( ).

13. Write a program that will copy m consecutive characters from a string s1 beginning at position n into another string s2.

14. Write a program to create a directory of students with roll numbers. The program should display the roll number for a specified name and vice-versa.

15. Given a string
```
	char str [ ] = “123456789” ;
```
Write a program that displays the following:
```
              1
            2 3 2
          3 4 5 4 3
        4 5 6 7 6 5 4
      5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5
```

16. Write a C program to compare two strings without using any string function.

17. Write a C program to find the largest and smallest sized word in a string.

18. Write a C program to replace all the white spaces in a string with double white spaces.

19. Write a C program to enter multiple strings and display them in lexicographical order.

20. Write a C program to concatenate two strings without using any string function.
